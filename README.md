## Project 2 - E-commerce Website

### Overview

This application allows users to browse for products and obtain information about each individual product. We built the front-end using React and fetched data from fakes.API.com using Axios requests.

### Technologies Used

- React
- React-bootstrap
- JavaScript

### Brief

This two-day paired hackathon tasked Husaam and me with creating a functional React application that consumes a public API. The application was required to feature multiple components and utilize a router for navigation.

#### Essential Requirements

- Integration of a public API into the application, relevant to its purpose.
- Development of various components to enhance functionality.
- Implementation of a router to facilitate navigation between different pages, as needed.
- Creation of wireframes outlining the application's design prior to development.
- Deployment of the application online for public access, hosted on a public GitHub repository.

### Planning

We decided to search for an API that provides comprehensive product information. Upon identifying the ideal API, we reviewed its documentation and found detailed product descriptions, images, and pricing details.

#### Wireframes

- **Homepage**: Nav bar containing an icon linking back to home and a burger menu with links to other pages. Displays all products, with a button to view individual product details.

- **Components Wireframe**: Layout of all website components.

### Approach Taken

**Day 1**: Despite unexpected challenges, I managed to complete essential tasks, displaying the API data on the homepage. We tested our APIs using Insomnia to ensure effective data transmission. Our focus was creating the homepage and a page to display all products.

**Day 2**: We focused on implementing basic CSS to enhance the website's visual appeal. Despite time constraints, we successfully completed the website, meeting our goal. Each of us handled one component before coming together to review and refine our work.

### Projects Wins and Key Learnings

- Built a fully working app in just two days.
- Managed complex and nested data structures effectively.
- Developed teamwork skills, learning to pair code and maintain good communication.

### Challenges

Time constraints led to pressure, but we managed to complete the project on time.

### Future Improvements

- Enhance website quality and appeal.
- Expand the range of components for a higher standard.
- Add search and filter functionality for products.
